Szótár is a bilingual dictionary and vocabulary learning program for Windows.

The program does not need to be installed to work, just extract the zip file and run Szotar.exe.

It is written in C# 5.0 and runs on .NET 4.5. It uses SQLite and System.Windows.Forms. Please give feedback if you have any; you can do so via the [issue tracking](http://code.google.com/p/szotar/issues/entry?template=Defect%20report%20from%20user) system.

## Current Progress ##
The current version is 0.6, and sports a quick and useful dictionary lookup, word list editing, tags, practising word lists, importing dictionaries in the zbedic format, importing word lists from Quizlet, and more. The roadmap is roughly:
  * **0.7**: Synchronisation with Quizlet
  * **0.8**: Better suggestions for practising
  * **0.9**: Improved UI for practice mode (screen showing lists, tags, etc.)
  * **1.0**: Dictionary enhancements, improved dictionary editing, import more formats (e.g. XDXF and StarDict)

There are [a number of large-ish dictionaries](http://bedic.sourceforge.net/dict-list-keyword-lang.html) in the zbedic format. StarDict and XDXF format support is planned.
